# NON COG - FiveM Server Status Bot

The main goal of this bot is to allow anyone to add the code to their bot or to use it as is.

## How to Edit
Almost all of the edits can be done in the config file.
- Add your IP and Prefix
- Don't touch anything else

**Note:** Lines that have `print("")` send those to your console. For example, Line 80. If you don't want that, just comment it out.
